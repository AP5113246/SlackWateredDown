# Flockr (Slack Watered Down)

# COMP1531 Major Project - Flockr (Bare Bones Version of Slack with Front End provided by Course)



## Content
This is one of my first major COMP group assignments where we made the backend of a bare bones version of Slack (called Flockr in this instance).
I did majority of the  work on the server.py server_test.py files, the initial structure and outline of the channel.py and channel_test.py and in user.py the user_profile_upload function.

## What I Learnt

This project taught me a lot about using:
*  GIT usage in a team environment
*  Delegation and management of work using Kanban boards following an AGILE methodology
*  Flask
*  Writing tests for functions and HTTP tests
*  Sending and recieving data using JSON


## Extra Notes
 README.md in the project-master folder holds the assignment specifications if there was any curiousity about the finer details and requirements
